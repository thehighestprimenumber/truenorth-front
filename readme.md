# Vite Project

This repository contains a Vite project, which is a minimalistic and fast build tool for modern web development. It provides a streamlined development experience with instant server startup and fast hot module replacement (HMR).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd vite-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will launch the development server, and you can access your application at the given url in your web browser.

The development server automatically watches for file changes and performs fast hot module replacement (HMR), which means your changes will be reflected instantly in the browser without a full page reload.
